# Splitter

<strong>TO B9 LAB FRIENDS/INSTRUCTORS</strong>

I've tried to build a generic contract instead of fixing Alice as the "sender". 
This way is possible to add different members and every member can send and split their ether.

I know that I still have A LOT TO DO, but I hope i'm on the right way! :)
